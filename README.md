# My 100 days of code challenge 2018 #
Started August 8th, 2018
## Why? ##
Because I need a sort of roadmap! Life is hectic. So I need accountability in the way of peer pressure to get more done. 

This will also help me take steps to build my portfolio, contacts, and confidence as I get ready to leave college for the "real" world.

## Rules ##
1. Code minimum an hour every day for the next 100 days.
2. Tweet your progress every day with the #100DaysOfCode hashtag.
3. Organize and note code on this **file**.
4. Upload code to this repo or link repo of code.

## Possible/Planned Projects ##
1) Refactoring old school projects or completely remaking depending on the amount of improvements that can be made.
2) Python Web App using machine learning to analyze sentiment towards Trump on Twitter.
3) Coursera machine learning course from Stanford taught by Andrew Ng. 
4) Blog Web App made with Python, Flask, React, and MongoDB.
5) Stock Online Dashboard(One version with a Python backend and maybe another with a Java/C++ backend). 
6) Some sort of Web Scapper to retrieve the top 100 items in a category and look up relevant infortmation to put alongside.
7) Contributing to an open source project
